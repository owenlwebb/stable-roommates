# A Python Implementation of Irving's Algorithm for the Stable Roommates Probem

Requires: Python 3.7

## Test Files
Each test file should contain a single JSON dictionary that maps names to a 
list of preferences. Each list of preferences should contain valid names 
of the other n - 1 participants. See included test files for examples.

In order to be recognized by the program, test file names should have the 
following extension:
```.test.json```

## To Run Test Files:
Simply clone the git repository and ensure your test files are in the same 
directory as srp.py.
```$ python3.7 srp.py```
